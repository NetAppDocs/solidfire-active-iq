You can view information about all nodes for a company, including throttled nodes, when you select the company name from the *All Nodes View* drop-down list. After you select the company name, it replaces *All Nodes View* in the top navigation bar.

NOTE: If your SolidFire Active IQ account has only one company name associated with it, the *All Nodes* and *Throttled Nodes* pages, available from the side panel, default to that company name.

|Heading |Description
|Cluster ID |Assigned cluster number when the cluster is created.
|Cluster | Name assigned to the cluster.
|Node ID | System-generated ID for the node.
|Status 
a|
The status of the node:

* Healthy: The node has no critical errors associated with it.
* Offline: The node cannot be accessed. Select the link to view the Error Log.
* Fault: There are errors associated with this node. Select the link to view the Error Log.
|Name | The system-generated node name.
|Type | Shows the model type of the node.
|Serial Number | Unique serial number assigned to the node.
|Version | Version of Element software running on the node.
|Management IP |Management IP address assigned to node for 1GbE or 10GbE network admin tasks.
|Storage IP |Storage IP address assigned to the node used for iSCSI network discovery and all data network traffic.
|Role
a|
Identifies what role the node has in the cluster:

* Cluster Master: The node that performs cluster-wide administrative tasks and contains the MVIP and SVIP.
* Ensemble Node: A node that participates in the cluster. There are either three or five ensemble nodes depending on cluster size.
* Fibre Channel: An FC node in the cluster.
* If a node does not have a role, the value is set to - (dash).

== View information about throttled nodes
On the *Throttled Nodes* page, available from the side panel, you can view information for all nodes with throttling greater than 1% in the last 30 days for your selected company.

In the Throttled Nodes page, you can view nodes with a high, limited, or combined (high and limited) throttling time. You can also view the descriptions of the *Throttled Nodes* page and the *High*, *Limited*, and *Combined* throttling time options by selecting the image:description.PNG[description] icon.
