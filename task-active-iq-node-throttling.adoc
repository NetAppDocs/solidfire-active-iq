On the *Nodes* > *Active Nodes* page, available from the side panel for a selected cluster, you can view node throttling graphs for the nodes in the cluster. The nodes are listed as thumbnail layouts on the left side of the display and are ordered depending on the degree of throttling for a selected time range.

You can select a date range from the calendar drop-down box or from a set of pre-defined ranges. Date ranges are calculated using the current browser time (at the time of selection) and the configured amount of time. Additionally, you can select a desired interval by brushing directly over the bar graph at the bottom. You can switch between nodes by selecting the thumbnail layouts on the left. The graphs and date ranges in Active IQ are seamlessly integrated with each other. When selecting a date range, all graphs on that page adjust to the range selected. The default date range displayed for each graph is seven days.

The graph displays the percentage throttling for the node:

* Green = up to 39%
* Yellow = 40 to 59%
* Red = above 59%

Position the mouse pointer over a graph line to see point-in-time details.
