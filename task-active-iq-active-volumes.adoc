== View active volume details
On the *Volumes* > *Active Volumes* page for a selected cluster, you can view the following information in the list of active volumes.

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,75"]
|===
|Heading	|Description

|ID	|ID given when the volume was created.
|Account ID |ID of the account assigned to the volume.
|Volume Size |Size of the volume from which the snapshot was created.
|Used Capacity a|Current used capacity of the volume:

* Green = up to 80%
* Yellow = above 80%
* Red = above 95%
|Primary Node ID |Primary node for this volume.
|Secondary Node ID |List of secondary nodes for this volume. Can be multiple values during transitory states, like change of secondary nodes, but will usually have a single value.
|QoS Throttle	a|Identifies if the volume is being throttled due to high load on the primary storage node:

* Green = up to 20%
* Yellow = above 20%
* Red = above 80%
|Min IOPS	|The minimum number of IOPS guaranteed for the volume.
|Max IOPS	|The maximum number of IOPS allowed for the volume.
|Burst IOPS	|The maximum number of IOPS allowed over a short period of time.
|Average IOPS Last 30 mins |The average number of IOPS executed for all volumes that have this node as their primary.

IOPS are collected over 500 millisecond intervals on the cluster side. SolidFire Active IQ collects these values at 60 second intervals. For each volume, the average IOPS is calculated from the SolidFire Active IQ values collected in the last 30 minutes.
|Average Throughput Last 30 mins |The average throughput executed for all volumes that have this node as their primary.

Throughput is collected over 500 millisecond intervals on the cluster side. SolidFire Active IQ collects these values at 60 second intervals. For each volume, the average throughput is calculated from the SolidFire Active IQ values collected in the last 30 minutes.
|Average Latency (Âµs) Last 30 min |The average time in microseconds to complete read and write operations to all volumes that have this node as their primary.

Latency is measured over 500 millisecond intervals on the cluster side. SolidFire Active IQ collects these values at 60 second intervals. For each volume, the average latency is calculated from the SolidFire Active IQ values collected in the last 30 minutes. For more information, see this https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/Element_Software/How_is_read_and_write_latency_measured_in_Element_Software_%3F[KB article^].
|Snapshots |The number of snapshots created for the volume.
|Actions |Select the vertical drop-down menu for more details on an individual volume.

== View individual volume details
From the *Volumes* page, you can view more information for an individual volume.

.Steps
. Select *Volumes* > *Active Volumes*.
. In the Actions column, select the image:more_information.PNG[More information] icon for the volume you want and select *View Details*.

After the page opens for the active volume, you can view recent volume data from the information bar.

|Average IOPS	|Average number of IOPS executed against the volume in the last 30 minutes.
|Average Throughput |Average throughput executed against the volume in the last 30 minutes.
|Average Latency |The average time, in microseconds, to complete read and write operations to the volume in the last 30 minutes. For more information, see this https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/Element_Software/How_is_read_and_write_latency_measured_in_Element_Software_%3F[KB article^].

|Burst IOPS	|The maximum number of IOPS allowed over a short period of time.
|512e Enabled |Identifies if 512e is enabled on a volume.
|QoS Throttle	|Identifies if the volume is being throttled due to high load on the primary storage node.
|Primary Node ID	|Primary node for this volume.
|Secondary Node ID |List of secondary nodes for this volume. Can be multiple values during transitory states, like change of secondary nodes, but will usually have a single value.
|Volumes Paired	|Indicates if a volume has been paired or not.
|Create Time |The time the volume creation task was completed.
|Block Size	|Size of the blocks on the volume.
|IQN |The iSCSI Qualified Name (IQN) of the volume.
|scsiEUIDeviceID |Globally unique SCSI device identifier for the volume in EUI-64 based 16-byte format.

== View individual volume performance graphs
From the *Volumes* page, you can view performance activity for each volume in a graphical format. This information provides real-time statistics for throughput, IOPS, latency, queue depth, average IO size, and capacity for each volume.

.Steps
. Select *Volumes* > *Active Volumes*.
. In the *Actions* column, select the image:more_information.PNG[More information] icon for the volume you want and select *View Details*.
+
A separate page opens to display an adjustable timeline, which is synced with the performance graphs.
. On the left, select a thumbnail graph to view performance graphs in detail. You can view the following graphs:
** Throughput
** IOPS
** Latency
** Queue Depth
** Average IO Size
** Capacity
. (Optional) You can export each graph as a CSV file by selecting the image:export_button.PNG[export button] icon.
