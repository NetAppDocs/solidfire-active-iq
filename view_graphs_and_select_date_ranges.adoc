The graphs and date ranges in Active IQ are seamlessly integrated with each other. When selecting a date range, all graphs on that page adjust to the range selected. The default date range displayed for each graph is seven days.

You can select a date range from the calendar drop-down box or from a set of pre-defined ranges. Date ranges are calculated using the current browser time (at the time of selection) and the configured amount of time. Additionally, you can select a desired interval by brushing directly over the bar graph at the bottom. If available, switch between graphs by selecting the thumbnail layouts on the left. These layouts can also be hidden.

Position the mouse pointer over a graph line to see point-in-time details.
