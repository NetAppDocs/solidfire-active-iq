== Virtual Volumes Details
The *VVols* > *Virtual Volumes* page for a selected cluster provides information about each active virtual volume on the cluster.

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===
|Heading |Description
|Volume ID |The ID of the underlying volume.
|Snapshot ID |The ID of the underlying volume snapshot. The value is zero if the virtual volume does not represent a snapshot.
|Parent Virtual Volume ID	|The virtual volume ID of the parent virtual volume. If the ID is all zeros, the virtual volume is independent with no link to a parent.
|Virtual Volume ID |The universal unique identifier of the virtual volume.
|Name	|The name assigned to the virtual volume.
|Guest OS Type |Operating system associated with the virtual volume.
|Type	|The virtual volume type: Config, Data, Memory, Swap, or Other.
|Access	|The read/write permissions assigned to the virtual volume.
|Size	|The size of the virtual volume in gigabytes (GB) or gibibytes (GiB).
|Used Capacity a|Current used capacity of the volume:

* Green = up to 80%
* Yellow = above 80%
* Red = above 95%
|Snapshot	|The number of associated snapshots. Select the number to link to the snapshot copy details.
|Min IOPS	|The minimum IOPS QoS setting of the virtual volume.
|Max IOPS	|The maximum IOPS QoS setting of the virtual volume.
|Burst IOPS	|The maximum burst QoS setting of the virtual volume.
|VMW_VmID	|Information in fields prefaced with "VMW_" are defined by VMware. See VMware documentation for descriptions.
|Create Time |The time the virtual volume creation task was completed.
|Actions	|Select the vertical drop-down menu for more details on an individual virtual volume.

|Heading	|Description
|Account ID	|The ID of the account associated with the storage container.
|Name	|The name of the storage container.
|Status
a|
The status of the storage container:

* Active: The storage container is in use.
* Locked: The storage container is locked.
|PE Type |Indicates the protocol endpoint type (SCSI is the only available protocol for Element software).
|Storage Container ID	|The universal unique identifier (UUID) of the virtual volume storage container.
|Active Virtual Volumes	|The number of active virtual volumes associated with the storage container.
|===

== Protocol Endpoints
The *VVols* > *Protocol Endpoints* page of the selected cluster provides protocol endpoint information such as primary provider ID, secondary provider ID, and protocol endpoint ID.

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,70"]

|Heading |Description
|Primary Provider ID |The ID of the primary protocol endpoint provider.
|Secondary Provider ID |The ID of the secondary protocol endpoint provider.
|Protocol Endpoint ID	|The UUID of the protocol endpoint.
|Protocol Endpoint State
a|
The status of the protocol endpoint:

* Active: The protocol endpoint is in use.
* Start: The protocol endpoint is starting.
* Failover: The protocol endpoint has failed over.
* Reserved: The protocol endpoint is reserved.
|Provider Type
|The type of the protocol endpoint's provider: Primary or Secondary.
|SCSI NAA Device ID	|The globally unique SCSI device identifier for the protocol endpoint in NAA IEEE Registered Extended Format.
|===

== Hosts
The *VVols* > *Hosts* page for a selected cluster provides information about VMware ESXi hosts that host virtual volumes.

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===
|Heading |Description
|Host ID |The UUID for the ESXi host that hosts virtual volumes and is known to the cluster.
|Bindings	|Binding IDs for all virtual volumes bound by the ESXi host.
|ESX Cluster ID	|The vSphere host cluster ID or vCenter GUID.
|Initiator IQNs	|Initiator IQNs for the virtual volume host.
|SolidFire Protocol Endpoint IDs |The protocol endpoints that are currently visible to the ESXi host.
|===

== Bindings
The *VVols* > *Bindings* page for a selected cluster provides binding information about each virtual volume.
