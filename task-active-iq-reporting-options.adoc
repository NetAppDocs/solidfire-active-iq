Learn about the *Reporting* drop-down menu in the side panel:

* <<Capacity>>
* <<Efficiency>>
* <<Performance>>
* <<Error log>>
* <<Events>>
* <<Alerts>>
* <<iSCSI Sessions>>
* <<Virtual Networks>>
* <<API Collection>>

== Capacity
On the *Capacity* page of the *Reporting* drop-down menu for a selected cluster, you can view details about the overall cluster space that is provisioned into volumes. Capacity information bars provide the current state and forecasts of block and metadata storage capacity for the cluster. The corresponding graphs provide additional methods for analyzing the cluster data.

NOTE: For details about severity levels and cluster fullness, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/element-software/index.html[Element Software documentation^].

The following descriptions give details about the block capacity, metadata capacity, and provisioned space on the selected cluster.

[cols=3*,options="header",cols="20,35,45"]

h|Heading h|Description	h|Forecast
|Used Capacity |Current used capacity of the cluster block. |Not applicable
|Warning Threshold |The current warning threshold. |Forecast for when the warning threshold will be reached.
|Error Threshold |The current error threshold. |Forecast for when the error threshold will be reached.
|Total Capacity |The total capacity for the block. |Forecast for when the critical threshold will be reached.
|Current State |Current state of the block.	|For details about severity levels, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/element-software/index.html[Element Software documentation^].
3+h|Metadata capacity
h|Heading 2+h|Description
|Used Capacity 2+a|The metadata cluster capacity used for this cluster.
|Total Capacity	2+a|The total available metadata capacity for this cluster and the critical threshold forecast.
|Current State 2+a|The current state of the metadata capacity for this cluster.
3+h|Provisioned space
h|Heading 2+h|Description
|Provisioned Space 2+a|The amount of space that is currently provisioned on the cluster.
|Max Provisioned Space 2+a|The maximum space that can be provisioned on the cluster.

== Efficiency
On the *Efficiency* page of the cluster *Reporting* drop-down menu for a selected cluster, you can view details about thin provisioning, deduplication, and compression on the cluster when you move your mouse pointer over data points on the graph.

NOTE:  All combined efficiencies are calculated by simple multiplication of the reported factor values.

The following descriptions give details about calculated efficiencies on the selected cluster.

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===
|Heading |Description
|Overall efficiency |The global efficiency of thin provisioning, deduplication, and compression multiplied together. These calculations do not take into account the double helix feature built into the system.
|Deduplication and Compression |The combined effect of space saved by using deduplication and compression.
|Thin Provisioning |The amount of space saved by using this feature. This number reflects the delta between the capacity allocated for the cluster and the amount of data actually stored.
|Deduplication |The ratio multiplier of the amount of space that was saved by not storing duplicate data in the cluster.
|Compression |The effect of data compression on stored data in the cluster. Different data types compress at different rates. For example, text data and most documents easily compress to a smaller space, but video and graphical images typically do not.
|===

== Performance
On the *Performance* page of the *Reporting* drop-down menu for a selected cluster, you can view details about IOPS usage, throughput, and cluster utilization by selecting the category and filtering based on time period.

== Error log
On the *Error Log* page of the *Reporting* drop-down menu for a selected cluster, you can view information about unresolved or resolved errors that have been reported by the cluster. This information can be filtered and exported to a comma-separated values (CSV) file. For details about severity levels, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/element-software/index.html[Element Software documentation^].

The following information is reported for the selected cluster.

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===
|Heading |Description
|ID |ID for a cluster fault.
|Date |The date and time the fault was logged.
|Severity |This can be warning, error, critical, or best practice.
|Type |This can be node, drive, cluster, service, or volume.
|Node ID |Node ID for the node that this fault refers to. Included for node and drive faults; otherwise set to - (dash).
|Drive ID |Drive ID for the drive that this fault refers to. Included for drive faults; otherwise set to - (dash).
|Resolved |Displays if the cause of the error has been resolved.
|Resolution Time |Displays the time an issue was resolved.
|Error Code	|A descriptive code that indicates what caused the fault.
|Details |Description of the fault with additional details.
|===

== Events
On the *Events* page of the *Reporting* drop-down menu for a selected cluster, you can view information about key events that have occurred on the cluster. This information can be filtered and exported to a CSV file.

The following information is reported for the selected cluster.

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===
|Heading |Description
|Event ID |Unique ID associated with each event.
|Event Time |The time the event occurred.
|Type |The type of event being logged, for example, API event or clone events. See the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/element-software/index.html[Element Software documentation^] for more information.
|Message |Message associated with the event.

== iSCSI Sessions
On the *iSCSI Sessions* page of the *Reporting* drop-down menu for a selected cluster, you can view details about the number of active sessions on the cluster and the number of iSCSI sessions that have occurred on the cluster.

.iSCSI Sessions example
[%collapsible]
====
image:iscsi_sessions.PNG[iSCSI Sessions]
====

You can move your mouse pointer over a data point on the graph to find the number of sessions for a defined time period:

* Active Sessions: The number of iSCSI sessions that are attached and active on the cluster.
* Peak Active Sessions: The maximum number of iSCSI sessions that have occurred on the cluster in the last 24 hours.

NOTE: This data includes iSCSI sessions generated by FC nodes.

== API Collection
On the *API Collection* page of the *Reporting* drop-down menu for a selected cluster, you can view the API methods used by the NetApp SolidFire Active IQ. For detailed descriptions of these methods, see the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/element-software/api/index.html[Element Software API documentation^].

NOTE: In addition to these methods, Active IQ makes some internal API calls used by NetApp Support and engineering to monitor cluster health. These calls are not documented as they can be disruptive to cluster functionality if used incorrectly. If you require a complete list of Active IQ API collections, you must contact NetApp Support.
