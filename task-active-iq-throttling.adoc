From the *QoS Management* > *Node Throttling* page, available from the side panel for a selected cluster, you can view the percent throttling for the nodes in the cluster. The nodes are listed as thumbnail layouts on the left side of the display and are ordered depending on the degree of throttling for a selected time range.

Learn about viewing node throttling information:

== View graphs and select date ranges

The graphs and date ranges in SolidFire Active IQ are seamlessly integrated with each other. When selecting a date range, all graphs on that page adjust to the range selected. The default date range displayed for each graph is seven days.

You can select a date range from the calendar drop-down box or from a set of pre-defined ranges. Date ranges are calculated using the current browser time (at the time of selection) and the configured amount of time. Additionally, you can select a desired interval by brushing directly over the bar graph at the bottom. You can switch between graphs by selecting the thumbnail layouts on the left.

The graphs display node throttling over the selected time period based on the minimum and maximum IOPS settings for the volumes hosted on the selected node. The color represents the amount of throttling: green (none), yellow (limited), or red (high). For more information, see the following graph example:

NOTE: From the Node Throttling page, you can determine if there is QoS pushback in a storage cluster, see this https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Software/Element_Software/How_to_check_for_QoS_pushback_in_Element_Software[KB article^] for information.

== Export node throttling data

You can export graph data to a comma-separated values (CSV) format. Only the information displayed in the graph is exported.
